# Video Clanka
I was bored, so I ended up playing with a bit of FFMPEG and Electron âœ¨

## What are used?
1. Electron Builder -  to create a basic UI application to upload a video and interact
2. FFMPEG - the actual library which processes media
3. Tailwind CSS

## Requirements
- Electron
- NPM

## Setup
- Clone the project
- npm run start (to see the app running on the go)
- npm run make (to package the whole thing and make a runnable application.)
